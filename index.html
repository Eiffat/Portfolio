            <h3>School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</h3>
            <p>Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by four powerful wizards: Godric Gryffindor,
                Salazar Slytherin, Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff. They chose to split the students
                into four ‘houses’, each bearing their surnames and featuring young wizards and witches who
                displayed abilities and personalities they wanted to nurture.

                <h3 class="orangered-color">Dark Creatures | Curses | Dark Charms</h3>
                <p> "The Dark Arts, are many, varied, ever-changing, and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a
                    many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer
                    than
                    before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible. Your defences must
                    therefore
                    be as flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo."

                <p> "You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making. As there is little foolish
                    wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really
                    understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power
                    of
                    liquids that creep through the human veins, bewitching the minds, ensnaring the senses... I can
                    teach
                    you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even stopper death - if you aren't as big a bunch of
                    dunderheads
                    as I usually have to teach."
